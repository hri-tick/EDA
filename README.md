# EDA
STEPS INVOLVED IN NOTEBOOK
WE PERFORM AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF UNKNOWN TIMESERIES DATASET
1)Look at data structure,time-series - r1 to r12, correlation between features, created data functions, normalization of time-series data

2)Visualize the time-series to gain insights into its pattern,trends over hourly,daily,monthly,seasonal timestamp and some other visualizations

3)using DTW method as it is a technique used to compare and measure the similarity between two time series data sequences on r1 to r12 = giving 66 combinations

DTW distances calculated on timeseries data over hourly,daily,monthly,seasonal timestamp

4)Using elbow method to determine no. of clusters for dtw_distances

5)Cluster visualization

6)Kmeans Clustering on r1 to r12, visualization of clusters

7)Analysis of Kmeans CLustering with respect to other features of Dataset
